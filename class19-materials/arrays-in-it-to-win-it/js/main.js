//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movieArr = ['Barbie', 'High School Musical', 'NCIS']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let first = movieArr[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLength = movieArr.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let arrLength1 = movieArr.length - 1
let last = movieArr[arrLength1]
